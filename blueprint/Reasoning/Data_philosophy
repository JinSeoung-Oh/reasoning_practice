The application of philosophical concepts from epistemology to the field of data science. 
This article focuses on three key ideas: inductive vs. deductive reasoning, skepticism, and pragmatism.

## Inductive vs. Deductive Reasoning
* Deductive Reasoning
  - Deductive reasoning happens in a sterile space where we create our premises
  - Creates conclusions logically derived from "premises". It forms a closed system where correct premises and logic result in airtight knowledge. 
    Data scientists use deductive reasoning when discussing model assumptions and validating their models.
* Inductive Reasoning
  - Inductive reasoning also involves premises and conclusions, but the premises are often evidence instead of logical propositions
  - Involves drawing conclusions based on "observations and evidence"(ex. data). 
    Unlike deductive reasoning, inductive reasoning operates in the messy world 
    and does not create logical contradictions even if conclusions are wrong. Machine learning, being inductive, 
    induces knowledge from available information.

## Skepticism
- Skepticism is a philosophical stance characterized by doubt or suspension regarding knowledge

* Problem of Induction
  -Skepticism arises from doubts regarding knowledge, especially in scenarios where historical observations may not predict future events accurately
  - ‘black swan’
     if you see one thousand swans and all of them are white, 
     you might conclude that all swans are white. Your world would be flipped upside down when you see your first black swan

* Data Science and Skepticism
  -skepticism in data science can be beneficial. It prevents blind belief, encourages rigorous validation, and helps communicate model limits to users. 
   Skepticism also assists in managing risks associated with model inaccuracies

## Pragmatism
* Right to Believe
  - Pragmatism counters skepticism, suggesting a "right to believe" based on evidence. 
    It emphasizes the practical consequences of beliefs and knowledge, asserting that facts become useful when applied.

* Balancing Confidence
  - A spectrum of confidence in knowledge, ranging from total skepticism to total dogmatism. 
    Pragmatism finds a balance in the middle, allowing beliefs supported by evidence

## How Skepticism and Pragmatism Make Better Data Scientists
* Skepticism
- Prevents blind acceptance, leading to more robust and defensible models
- Encourages clear communication of model limits to users
- Helps manage risks associated with model inaccuracies
- Prevents blind acceptance of counterintuitive model results

* Pragmatism
- Focuses on results-driven data science
- Encourages asking "so what?" to ensure valuable insights
- Prevents "analysis paralysis" by gathering information relevant to decisions
- Provides a basis for understanding a model's value and comparing models
- Allows belief in a model's usefulness based on evidence

Understanding reasoning approaches, being skeptical yet practical, and striking a balance 
between confidence extremes can contribute to building more impactful and valuable data science models
