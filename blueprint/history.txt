  I tried to search the data set for this practice, but couldn't find it.

  condition 1. Image data should contain human and background(ex. object, sky...)
  condition 2. The situation should be inferred from the rest of the information except for the main character in given image
  condition 3. From the situation or image iteself(priority), the purpose of the main character should be inferred

The image generation model was the last way for data collection, but from now on, I have to use if for making dataset.. (at least 10,000)

And have to check below lise
1. How to design ontology to produce the intended result(predicting emotion state - cause of emotion pair or what the main character in the picture wants right now)
2. How to design ontology which contain various scenario
3. How to enhance ontological path to personalize
4. How to handle Minigpt4 (to produce the inteded result - contain emotion state and inferred wants)

Most of all, Emotion state is really needed? Although the ultimate goal is to create a model for person with autism...
But it is really needed for un-autism person...?

For image generation, I will use https://github.com/lucidrains/imagen-pytorch not dall-e model. Imagen is more easy to use
After code and usage analyzing, I will revise it for my own purpose : https://github.com/JinSeoung-Oh/reasoning_practice/blob/main/blueprint/image_generate/imagen-pytorch/imagen.txt

~2023.07.25
After anayzing imagen-pytorch code and paper, I have to consider using this model. Cuz I need checkpoint but this repository does not offer it.
1. Try to find out imagen-pytorch checkpoint
2. Try to find out imagen checkpoint and apply it on imagen-pytorch
3. Just use imagen
4. Back to the dall-e model

~2023.07.27
I cannot find out imagen weight. Have to back to the dalle-e model and find out its weights..
If I cannot find out dall-e weight.. then try to find out the other model

Checking https://github.com/jina-ai/dalle-flow/tree/8539f97995f0d6d139edfefcd670c914cd06c366
This repository is about server for dalle 2
I don't need server, so I will pass it

2023.08.03 ~ 2023.08.03
checking https://github.com/lucidrains/DALLE2-pytorch
This repository is useful.
I will test it for my own project

2023.08.03 ~ 2023.08.14
Testing : https://github.com/lucidrains/DALLE2-pytorch (code base)
--> https://github.com/LAION-AI/dalle2-laion (trained model)

2023.08.15 ~
08.15 --> dalle2-laion take some time for downloading weight and make a image.. And it is fail downloading new version of dalle2-laion. 
          And its result is just trash.(prompt : some people enjoy the party)
          So, I have to check it(Can I download new version?). 
          And to generate image, I have to enter prompt in terminal. I think it is not good
          So, I will try to make it can handle corpus

08.21 --> dalle2-iaion model show pool result.. I will try to someting and then diside ust it or not 
08.22 --> start check stable diffusion v2 + re-check dalle2-iaion
          -- future work-- 
          + https://github.com/monarch-initiative/ontogpt (check this)
          + check miniGPT

08.27 --> I will use stable diffusion v2 and image variant model. To handle korean, I will add translation model
          -- future work-- 
          + https://github.com/monarch-initiative/ontogpt (check this)
          + check miniGPT
