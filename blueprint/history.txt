  I tried to search the data set for this practice, but couldn't find it.

  condition 1. Image data should contain human and background(ex. object, sky...)
  condition 2. The situation should be inferred from the rest of the information except for the main character in given image
  condition 3. From the situation or image iteself(priority), the purpose of the main character should be inferred

The image generation model was the last way for data collection, but from now on, I have to use if for making dataset.. (at least 10,000)

And have to check below lise
1. How to design ontology to produce the intended result(predicting emotion state - cause of emotion pair or what the main character in the picture wants right now)
2. How to design ontology which contain various scenario
3. How to enhance ontological path to personalize
4. How to handle Minigpt4 (to produce the inteded result - contain emotion state and inferred wants)

Most of all, Emotion state is really needed? Although the ultimate goal is to create a model for person with autism...
But it is really needed for un-autism person...?

For image generation, I will use https://github.com/lucidrains/imagen-pytorch not dall-e model. Imagen is more easy to use
After code and usage analyzing, I will revise it for my own purpose
